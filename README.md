#Networking Practice#

I started this project to get some practice with the code in Lewis Van Winkle's amazing book on network programming in C. I adapted the code slightly to utilize C++'s object oritented programming functionality. This has been
very helpful in terms of getting me more accustomed to using system calls as well as abstracting away Operating System differences and seemlessly using the same code.
